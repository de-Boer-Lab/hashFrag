# Overview

Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools to understand the functional relationship between genomic sequences and various biological processes. However, current practices of training and evaluating models on genomic sequences may fail to account for the widespread homology that permeates the genome. Homology spanning test-train data splits can result in [data leakage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_(machine_learning)#:~:text=In%20statistics%20and%20machine%20learning,when%20run%20in%20a%20production), potentially leading to overestimation of model performance and a reduction in model reliability and generalizability.

hashFrag is a scalable command-line tool to help users address homology-based data leakage during model development. The general workflow involves identifying “candidate” pairs of sequences exhibiting high similarity with [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), filtering these candidates based on a specified similarity threshold, and then using the resulting homology information to mitigate the potential occurrences of data leakage in existing or newly-created splits. 

We utilize local alignment scores to quantify the degree of homology between a pair of sequences. By default, the alignment score will be derived from the top BLAST alignment result for a pair of sequences, which we refer to as "hashFrag-lightning" mode (see Basic usage). However, users also have the option to manually compute alignment scores to be used in downstream steps for added control over the homology search process. This version, termed “hashFrag-pure” mode, can lead to improved recall when using exact alignment scores (see Advanced usage and `/tutorials` for more details).

# Installation

It is recommended to execute hashFrag in a `conda` or `virtualenv` environment with Python version 3.10.

Clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/de-Boer-Lab/hashFrag.git
```

Install dependencies located in the `requirements.txt` file with the folowing command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Export the source directory to your `PATH` with the following command:
```
export PATH="$PATH:./hashFrag/src"
```

**Optional**: To avoid running this command every time you open a terminal, add it to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`) with the following command:
```
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:./hashFrag/src"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## BLAST+ download

To install the suite of BLAST applications, follow the instructions found at the NCBI BLAST Command Line Applications User Manual [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/).

Directly download the BLAST+ package executables for different operating systems at the following FTP page:
> https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/

Follow the instructions to extract the downloaded file and export binaries to your `PATH`. 

Verify that `blastn` and `makeblastdb` commands were installed succesfully:
```
blastn -version
makeblastdb -version
```

# Basic usage

Example usage of hashFrag is provided below on an example dataset composed of 10,000 sequences (each 200 base pairs in length).

Note that the `filter_existing_splits` and `create_orthogonal_splits` pipelines require specification of a pairwise alignment score threshold to define homology between sequences. If users do not have a predefined threshold for homology, we recommend computing pairwise alignment scores between a set of random (e.g., dinucleotide shuffled) genomic sequences, and then defining a threshold above the distribution of values observed.

## Existing data splits

Existing train-test data splits can be handled by providing two separate FASTA files to hashFrag as input. This limits the homology search process to inter-data split comparisons. Specifically, a BLAST database is constructed over the train sequences and the test sequences are queried against this database to identify pairs with high local alignment scores. 

> Filter sequences in the test split exhibiting homology with any sequences in the train split.
```
hashFrag filter_existing_splits \
--train_fasta_path example_train_split.fa.gz \
--test_fasta_path example_test_split.fa.gz \
-t 60 \ # threshold
-o filter_existing_splits.work
```

> Stratify the test split sequences into an arbitrary number of levels based on their maximum alignment scores to the train split sequences. 
```
hashFrag stratify_test_split \
--train_fasta_path example_train_split.fa.gz \
--test_fasta_path example_test_split.fa.gz \
-o stratify_test_split.work
```
Note that the sizes of each stratified level will not necessarily be balanced. This can be useful to better understand a model’s behaviour over test splits at varying levels of orthogonality to the sequences the model was trained on.

## Creating data splits

When a single FASTA file is provided as input, hashFrag will characterize homology for all pairwise comparisons. This involves constructing a BLAST database over all sequences in the population and then subsequently querying each sequence to the databae. 

> Create homology-aware (i.g., orthogonal) train-test data splits.
```
hashFrag create_orthogonal_splits \
-f example_full_dataset.fa.gz \
-t 60 \
-o create_orthogonal_splits.work
```
The creation of orthogonal train-test splits involves encoding the homologous relationships between sequences as a sparse adjacency matrix (unweighted in accordance with the alignment score threshold). A graph representation of the adjancency matrix is constructed, and then distinct groups of homologous sequences can be identified by finding disconnected subgraphs. From the homology cluster information, splits with no leakage can be created proportionally. 

# Advanced usage

The basic usage commands are implemented as pipelines that execute a series of modules. To provide users with additional control and flexibility over this homology search process, users can directly call these modules.

| Pipeline                   | Modules            |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| `filter_existing_splits`   | `blastn_module`, `filter_candidates_module`, `filter_test_split_module` |
| `stratify_test_split`      | `blastn_module`, `stratify_test_split_module` |
| `create_orthogonal_splits` | `blastn_module`, `filter_candidates_module`, `identify_homologous_groups_module`, `create_orthogonal_splits_module` |

The main advantage of calling modules individually is that it enables the use of manually computed pairwise scores. For example, after identifying candidate pairs of sequences with the BLAST algorithm, instead of using BLAST-derived alignment scores users can provide the exact [Smith-Waterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm) local alignment scores for candidate pairs. This may be particularly important for improving recall in cases where the degree of homology between a pair of sequences is "modest". 

When providing precomputed pairwise scores to hashFrag, the expected format is a tab-delimited file with 3 columns: `id_i`, `id_j`, and `score`. 

`example.tsv`
```
seq_A	seq_B	60
seq_C	seq_D	85
seq_E	seq_A	100
...     ...     ...
```
